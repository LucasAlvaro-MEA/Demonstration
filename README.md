# Demonstration

Hello,

Welcome to this repository showing results from my projects and linking to the codes of them.

This project writing in python on Jupyter Notebook is about planning, control and machine learning on autonomous vehicles.
On this course, I followed a project on crazyflies and make them fly by position-based and deplacement-based.
With DronesControl.mp4, you can see them fly and performing differents tasks.
Explicit code can be found :https://github.com/LucasAlvaro-MEA/Autonomous-vehicles

This project is to build an autonomous minicar for the NXPCUP.
On Atollic, we code a FreeRTOS system on C/C++ to do image processing, control and set-up for the microprocessor KL25Z.
With Car_NXPCUP.mp4, you can see the autonomous car on the circuit.

This project is coded on Matlab and it's controlling on VREP a robotic arm in order to perform simple tasks as writing or picking.
Robotis6ddl is a picture of the control on VREP.

This project is coded on Vivado by VHDL. 
I coded on the Basys3 xc7a35tcpg, a digicode.
